The Iris flower dataset is also known as Fisher's Iris dataset. This has records on the length and width measures for sepals and petals. It consists of 50 records for each of three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris viriginca, and Iris versicolor. It was used by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, a well known statistician and geneticist, in his 1936 paper 'The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems'. These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.

Some more information about the dataset:

3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm

Column Name:
sepal_length
sepal_width

class

In order to analyse the data, it must first be added to the repository.

This dataset is  availabe for download here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
and in CSV format here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/7xwsksdpy3/1

It can then be analysed using Jupyter data variables and any empty cells or discrepencies in the data can be amended. In this dataset this did not to be done. r On investigating the scatter plots and histograms, it becomes clear that the strongest defining characteristic of the iris flower to determine which species it belongs to, is the petal length and width. Clusters can be clearly observed when reviewed.
