The Iris flower dataset is also known as Fisher's Iris dataset. This has records on the length and width measures for sepals and petals. It consists of 50 records for each of three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris viriginca, and Iris versicolor. It was developed by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, a well known statistician and geneticist.
