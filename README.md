"If we want to do better data science, we can never overlook the content knowledge underlying the data that weâ€™re dealing with" - https://towardsdatascience.com/the-iris-dataset-a-little-bit-of-history-and-biology-fb4812f5a7b5

The Iris flower dataset is also known as Fisher's Iris dataset. This has records on the length and width measures for sepals and petals. It consists of 50 records for each of three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris viriginca, and Iris versicolor. It was used by Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, a well known statistician and geneticist, in his 1936 paper 'The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems'. These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species.
